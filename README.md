# 2D Shadow Experiment
Testing 2D Shadows In Real Time Using Python3 And Pygame

![Screenshot Of Game (Older Version)](https://github.com/AndrewDMorgan/Shadow-Experiment/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-11-06%20at%208.24.16%20PM.png)

# Concept
The idea for the game is that it will be a multiplayer survial game. People will be able to team up into factions and if they want they can form their own goverment or socity. There will be one world (depending on the size of the game possibly more withe custom servers but im not sure). A player will loose everything upon death (and will respawn as someone else or something like that, im also not entirly sure on this yet). The game will be made in pyhton3 using pygame and PyVectors.
